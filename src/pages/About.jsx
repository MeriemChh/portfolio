  <h2>üéì Education</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Computer Science B.S.</strong> ‚Äì Amar Thelidji University of Laghouat (2022 - 2025)<br />
      During my studies, I focused on Web Development, Software Engineering, and UX Design. The program challenged me to think logically, problem-solve efficiently, and continuously learn ‚Äî especially as I transitioned into full-stack development and started building real-world apps.
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>
      <strong>English Literature & Language (2 years) </strong> ‚Äì Amar Thelidji University of Laghouat (2020 - 2022)<br />
      Before switching to Computer Science, I pursued English as my first major. I excelled in communication, critical thinking, and academic writing ‚Äî skills that still serve me well today. Although I chose to follow a more technical and challenging path, my time in the English department taught me clarity, precision, and confidence in self-expression.
